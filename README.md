Some sample Android Projects


The TipCalc is designed to show how different components can interact with each other.


The Simple Input Display just does exactly that - takes user input and displays it.


There are 2 versions of a Stock quote app, one uses the DOM traversal and one is an upgraded version that usues XmlPullParser.

The Vesrion that traverses the DOM is corrupted I think so probably needs rebuilt but is included as a set of style examples.
